# Advanced umg
Custom UMG widgets used in HYPE.

UE4 marketplace has a couple of plugins with data sheets UI. But those are either too heavy,more like full fledged Google Sheets,or they are minimalistic but lack an essential functionality such as rows/cells editing and CSV import/export. This work contains a simple editable data table UI with a planned support of data sheet structures such as CSV and custom data formats via Json files and maybe, in the future, google/excel sheets support will be added as well.
This is WIP, nothing usable yet.

## Widget types

**DataSheet** editable data sheet which can be populated from CSV or custom data structure. Rows can be added/removed, cell's content is editable.

**SuperButton**  extended UMG button with left mouse double click event.
